    <h3>The Lions</h3>
    <hr>
        <div>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense
        forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and
        at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and
        composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when
        hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe</div>
